Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a university student studying and pursuing M.Sc Mathematics as a major. I have great interest in low level software development, graphical programming, and experimenting with data structures and applications.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a 3D graphics engine using C++ and OpenGL.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Cryptology about different encryption and hashing algorithms in hopes of creating a encryption system.

I have a YouTube Channel where I create various tutorials on what I am interested in or learning at the moment.
