Hi, I'm Bikash Samanta, a developer with a passion for mathematics, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. Iâ€™m currently exploring advanced AI techniques and working on implementing encryption schemes.

## ðŸš€ Current Projects

### Machine Learning Exploration
Learning and experimenting with **Machine Learning** algorithms across various paradigms, such as:
- **Supervised Learning**: Regression, Classification (SVM, Decision Trees, etc.)
- **Deep Learning**: GAN, CNN, FNN, RNN, etc.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction (K-Means, PCA)
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Building agents that learn from interaction with the environment

### Cryptographic Library  
Iâ€™m developing a **Cryptographic Library** focused on **Symmetric** and **Asymmetric** encryption schemes, building secure, practical algorithms to deepen my cryptography expertise.

### Infinity-Lab
Developing a **Math Assistant** designed to solve complex mathematical problems. The project aims to help students and professionals alike by providing solutions to algebraic, calculus, linear algebra, and other mathematical topics.

## ðŸ§  Interests
- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Cryptography**
- **Blockchain**

## ðŸ’» Technical Skills

### Tools & Platforms
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Operating Systems**: Linux (Arch)
- **IDE/Editors**: VS Code, Vim
